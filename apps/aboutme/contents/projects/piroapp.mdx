#### About our Club System

**Pirogramming** is a club for students interested in **web development**.
We offer various sessions on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Django, followed by a team project period.

Our club operates with specific rules:

- Mandatory **attendance**
- Initial **deposit system**: members pay a certain amount of money upon joining
- Session-based **assignments**: Sessions are held 3 times a week, and members must complete assignments
- Deposit deductions for lateness, absence, or missed assignments
- Deposit refund upon graduation
- Two-month program per generation, two generations per year
- Previous generation manages club operations, recruitment, and mentoring

#### Problem We Aimed to Solve

Despite our club's 10-year history and systematic structure, we were still managing attendance, assignments, and deposits **manually using Excel files.**
As a development club, we recognized the need to **automate our management system to reduce workload and increase data accuracy.**

#### Building the Dev Team & 3w Study

To refine our old-fashioned system with development, we formed an **official development team** called **"Pironeer"**(Pioneer+Pirogramming), and embarked on an **intensive 3-week study of React Native (front-end) and Node.js (back-end)** to meet our deployment deadline before recruitment.

Our schedule was as follows:

| Date         | Task               |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| 9.4 ~ 9.22   | Study              |
| 9.23 ~ 10    | Development        |
| 10.23        | Firt Deployment    |
| 11.21 ~ 12.2 | 20th Recruitment   |
| 12.22        | 20th Program Start |

<br />
<br />

#### Confirming the Features

We needed two separate interfaces for **members** and **administrators**.

We identified four key features for our application:

| Feature      | Members                                                                                    | Admin                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attendance   | View session time and location by date / Verify attendance with a code during session time | View session time and location by date / Generate verification codes, Manage attendance for members |
| Deposit      | Check deposit balance, Use coupons to refill deposit                                       | Manage member deposits, Issue deposit refill coupons                                                |
| Assignment   | View assignment details, Time remaining, and Grades                                        | Create assignments, Grade assignments                                                               |
| Announcement | View announcements                                                                         | Post and manage announcements                                                                       |

#### Design

We used **Figma** to create wireframes and design the user interface.

#### Deployment

We successfully deployed the application on both iOS and Android platforms, making it accessible to all club members.
I took charge of the **iOS deployment process**, which proved to be a **challenging** yet **enlightening experience**.

Meeting the **App Store's stringent requirements** was no easy task.
Many developers face rejections and spend months trying to get their apps approved.
However, our tight timeline demanded a more efficient approach.
Thankfully, our application **passed the review on the first try.**

Key lessons from the iOS deployment experience:

- **Stay updated with Apple's changing guidelines**
- **Thorough documentation is crucial due to the complex process**
- **Remove incomplete features before submission**
- **Research common rejection reasons and App Store guidelines as much as possible**
- **Conduct comprehensive testing prior to submission**

As the saying goes, **"The first step is always the hardest."**
While the initial deployment was challenging, the experience and knowledge gained have paved the way for smoother processes in future app releases.

#### Efficiency & Accuracy Improvement

- Reduced attendance check time **from 15+ minutes to mere seconds**
- Decreased disputes by over **80%** compared to the previous generation
- Automated deposit management, allowing real-time balance checks
- Streamlined overall management tasks, increasing operational efficiency

#### Feedback from the Club

The 20th members was the first to use the app, and their response was overwhelmingly positive:

- New members expressed pride in having a club-specific application
- The app fostered a sense of unity and strengthened club bonds

<Header title="Lessons Learned" />

#### Purpose-Driven Design and Ownership

This project provided valuable **end-to-end experience**, from **team formation to problem identification &gt; planning &gt; UX consideration &gt; design &gt; development &gt; operation &gt; and maintenance.**
**The satisfaction of automating manual processes and simplifying operations through our application was immensely rewarding as a developer.**

#### Handling Unforeseen User Behavior

Despite implementing exception handling during development, we encountered **unexpected user behaviors** that led to errors.

For example:

- Attendance check-in errors due to **clicking multiple times**
- Unexpected **app crashes** when users **switched between screens quickly**
- Data synchronization issues when users had **poor internet connectivity**

Key Learnings:

- Users often interact with apps in ways developers don't expect. It's crucial to consider various usage scenarios.
- This experience emphasized the **importance of real-world testing** and **continuous improvement based on user feedback.**

Next Step:

- **Beta Testing**: Engage a diverse group of users to test the app before full deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Implement tools to track user behavior and app performance for ongoing improvements. (e.g. [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/))

#### Make It Work First, Even If It's Messy

Our code could be described as **"functional but messy."**
This approach, however, proved to be invaluable for our project's success.

None of our team members had extensive experience with React, yet we managed to learn React Native in just three weeks and complete a functional product.
**Had we focused on meticulous learning and code quality from the start, we might have missed the opportunity to gain hands-on operational experience.**
While our initial approach may have lacked finesse, it allowed us to rapidly develop and deploy a working application.
This experience reinforces the idea that sometimes, **the best way to learn is by doing, even if the result isn't perfect.**
Now that I've gained practical experience with React Native, **I'm eager to improve my code quality in future projects.**

Next Steps:

- **Study React in-depth** (like how React works under the hood)
- **Deeply explore code quality principles and best practices**
- Implement **state management**
- Incorporate **test-driven development**
- **Collaboration with designers for better UI/UX**
