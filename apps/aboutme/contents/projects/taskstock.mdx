<Header title="About TaskStock" />
<br />

TaskStock is an productivity app that **visualizes personal growth through a stock market-inspired interface**.

The core features include:

- **Dynamic Value Visualization**: Completed tasks instantly increase your personal "stock value," displayed as a rising graph. Daily midnight settlements show cumulative progress.
- **Project Management**: Group tasks for long-term goals and write retrospectives to add meaning to your accomplishments.
- **Community-Driven Task Market**: Browse popular tasks or "stocks" added by the community. Compare your productivity with others and gain inspiration.
- **Social Connectivity**: Follow friends, view their progress, and motivate each other. Privacy settings allow control over who sees your tasks.
- **Intuitive Growth Tracking**: Easily monitor your personal development through visual representations of your daily achievements.

TaskStock transforms routine task management into an engaging, social experience. It combines elements of gamification, social networking, and traditional productivity tools to create a unique platform for personal growth and motivation.

<br />

Our primary challenge was to create a unified system that could manage both email and social login users, support multi-device usage, and maintain persistent login states, all while ensuring a seamless user experience.

#### Key Challenges

- **Integrated authentication for both email and social login users**
- **Multi-Device Support**
- **Persistent login state** with minimal manual re-authentication
- **Balance between user experience and system security**
- Designing an **efficient token storage strategy**

#### Authentication Logic Design

We designed a comprehensive authentication logic in close collaboration with the backend team.
For email logins, we implemented a secure method of storing encrypted login information using **react-native-keychain**, enabling **background re-authentication when refresh tokens expired**.
However, social logins required a separate approach due to their unique authentication processes.

#### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was **minimizing automatic logouts while maintaining system security**.
After extensive research and consultation with industry professionals, **we decided to extend the refresh token validity period significantly.**
To mitigate potential security risks, we planned for a future implementation of a monitoring system that would immediately invalidate tokens upon detection of suspicious activities.

#### Token Management Strategy

We adopted a hybrid approach for token storage:

- Access tokens: Stored in both AsyncStorage and Redux for quick access and performance
- Refresh tokens: Securely stored only in AsyncStorage
- Expiration times: Managed in Redux for efficient checking

<Table>
<div>

#### User Experience Enhancements

To improve usability, we implemented features such as:

- **Background auto-login for regular users**
- **Extended refresh token validity for social login users**
- **Displaying recent login methods** for user convenience
- Implementing strategy-based login to **prevent account conflicts**
- Designing a system to handle token expiration during app inactivity

#### Security Considerations

While prioritizing user experience, we maintained a strong focus on security:

- Encrypted storage of sensitive information
- Planned implementation of an abnormal access detection system
- Regular security audits and updates

  width={300}
  height={400}
  alt="recent login"
  description="displaying recent login method"
/>
</Table>

#### Multi-Device Support

We implemented device-specific IDs and managed **multiple refresh tokens per user**.
This approach required careful design of our database structure and token management logic, allowing seamless user experiences across different devices.

#### Key Takeaways

- The critical balance between user experience and security in authentication systems
- The importance of adapting solutions to different login methods (email vs. social)
- The value of seeking expert advice and industry best practices
- The need for continuous monitoring and improvement in security systems

#### Folder Structure and Component Sharing

In our project, we encountered numerous shared components across screens. We organized these shared components outside specific screen folders:

<Table>
```text title="folder structure"
/components
ㄴ/atoms
   ㄴA
   ㄴB
ㄴ/molecules
   ㄴA
   ㄴB
ㄴ/organisms
   ㄴA
   ㄴB
ㄴ/templates
   ㄴA
   ㄴB
```

```text title="molecule"
ㄴ/molecules
   ㄴ/A
   ㄴ/B
   ㄴcommon1.tsx
   ㄴcommon2.tsx
```

</Table>

In retrospect, creating a '/common' folder for each atomic level (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) could have improved organization.

#### Flexible Atom Design

To enhance reusability, we designed atoms with high flexibility:

- Utilized extensive props
- Set default values for frequently used props
- Leveraged TypeScript for prop type restrictions
- Added props as needed during development

Example: A Text component with props for fontSize, color, and fontWeight, using default values and TypeScript types to restrict color options.

#### Balancing Reusability

As the project progressed, we realized that excessive focus on reusability could lead to code complexity.
We adopted a more flexible approach for molecules, organisms, and templates, prioritizing clean code over strict reusability.

#### Addressing Props Drilling

To mitigate props drilling issues inherent in the atomic design pattern, we:

- Organized components into screen-specific folders within each atomic level
- Utilized Redux Toolkit for state management
- Created custom hooks to minimize prop passing

#### Advantages of Atomic Design Pattern

- Provides a clear, intuitive structure
- Enables flexible responses to changing design requirements
- Facilitates consistent design across the application

#### Challenges Faced

- Ambiguous criteria for categorizing components into atomic levels
- Risk of over-complicating components for the sake of reusability
- Potential for props drilling in deeply nested component structures

#### Lessons Learned

- The importance of team agreement on component categorization
- The need to balance reusability with code simplicity
- The value of state management tools and custom hooks in atomic design implementation

#### Agile Methodology: Weekly Sprints and Stand-up Meetings

<Table>
<div>

We implemented weekly sprints following the Agile methodology, with a structured routine:

- Role assignment
- Task creation
- Execution
- Retrospective

Bi-weekly stand-up meetings were held on Wednesdays and Fridays at 10 PM via Zep, where team members shared:

- Completed tasks
- Upcoming tasks
- Potential blockers

Key benefits of our Agile approach:

- Frequent priority reassessment
- Structured development process
- Enhanced communication
- Goal-oriented work ethic
- Improved project visibility
- Adaptability to changes
- Strong team cohesion

This approach significantly boosted productivity, team coordination, and project clarity.

<div>

The Tech Wiki page in our TaskStock Notion workspace became an invaluable resource for the team. It served as a platform for:

- Documenting newly acquired technical knowledge
- Sharing development insights and best practices
- Collaborative problem-solving through issue documentation
- Open communication via mentions and discussions

This wiki fostered a culture of continuous learning and knowledge exchange within the team.

In response to Google Play Store's policy changes, we conducted a beta testing phase for TaskStock.
While the new policy required Android apps to undergo testing with **at least 20 beta testers for 2 weeks**, we expanded our scope to include iOS users as well.
Our beta test ran for **3 weeks with 46 testers across both platforms**, exceeding the minimum requirements and ensuring a thorough evaluation of our app.

We utilized **Google Forms to conduct satisfaction surveys and actively sought personal feedback from our testers**.
This comprehensive approach yielded invaluable insights:

- Uncovered unexpected issues and user reactions
- Provided a basis for more rigorous Quality Assurance (QA) processes
- Allowed us to address platform-specific concerns for both Android and iOS

This extended beta testing phase not only helped us meet regulatory requirements but also significantly improved the overall quality and user experience of TaskStock across both major mobile platforms.
The diverse feedback we received enabled us to refine features, fix bugs, and optimize performance before the official launch, ensuring a more polished and user-friendly product for our target audience.
