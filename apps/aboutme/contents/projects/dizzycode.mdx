#### ðŸ¤” Problem: Can't include custom headers

Let's first understand the process of a Websocket connection. **1. Initial HTTP Request:**

The WebSocket connection begins with an initial HTTP GET request,
which includes an "Upgrade" header asking to switch the protocol to
WebSocket.

**2. Server Response:**

The server approves the WebSocket upgrade with a "101 Switching Protocols" response.

**3. Protocol Upgrade:**

At this point, the HTTP protocol is upgraded to WebSocket, and further
communication occurs through WebSocket frames rather than HTTP
headers.

In other words, **custom headers are only valid during the initial GET request.**
At this stage, it might make sense to try sending tokens via custom
headers. However, once the WebSocket connection is established, all
further communication is done via WebSocket frames, and HTTP headers
are no longer used. Additionally, **browsers do not allow certain custom headers to be included in WebSocket upgrade requests**
due to security reasons, such as preventing CSRF attacks.

#### âœ… Solution: Introducing Secondary Token

**Including a short-lived authentication token in the query string** may be the most practical and secure approach.

For convenience, Iâ€™ll refer to this as ST. This method solves the
security issues I've encountered. Letâ€™s go over the logic step by
step:

<Box>
  **[CLIENT]**

- The client requests an ST using the JWT.

**[SERVER]**

- The server receives the JWT, verifies it, and issues the ST.
- The ST has a very short lifespan, typically around 30 seconds.

**[CLIENT]**

- The client includes the ST in the query parameters when requesting
  the WebSocket upgrade.

**[SERVER]**

- The server extracts and verifies the ST using a `HandshakeInterceptor`.

</Box>

Once the WebSocket upgrade is complete, the STOMP connection and
message transmission use the JWT.

**Advantages of this Method:**

- **Short-lived ST:** Since the ST has a very short
  lifespan, even if exposed, the risk is minimal.

- **Limited scope:** The ST is used solely for the WebSocket upgrade process, meaning it has more restricted
  permissions compared to a general access token.

- **Independent management of WebSocket and JWT:** Using
  an ST allows us to manage the WebSocket connection state
  independently of the JWTâ€™s state. Even if the access token expires,
  we can request a new one before establishing the WebSocket
  connection, keeping the logic cleanly separated.

#### ðŸ¤” Problem 1: Limited Browser Support

While the `Can I use` website indicates that most modern browsers support WebSocket, it's important to note that **it does not support in older versions and specific environments.**
This limitation can affect the reach and compatibility of applications relying solely on WebSocket.

#### âœ… Solution: Fallback Mechanism

Environments that do not support Websocket can use **alternative technologies such as polling, long polling, streaming**, etc.
This fallback mechanism is used to address browser compatibility issues, and libraries like **SockJS** or **Socket.IO** utilize it.

#### ðŸ¤” Problem 2: Data is Too Raw

The WebSocket protocol allows for the transmission of text and binary frames, but **it doesn't provide a predefined format or structure for messages.**
This lack of structure presents several issues:

- As projects grow, developers must design and manage complex logic for:
  - Determining message types
  - Handling message transmission between client and server
  - Parsing incoming messages
- The flexibility in data types and message structures, while offering freedom, also introduces the **burden of definition and management.**
- Without a standardized approach, maintaining consistency in message handling across different parts of the application can become increasingly difficult.

These issues highlight **the need for additional protocols atop WebSocket** to provide more **structured communication** in complex applications.

#### âœ… Solution: STOMP Protocol

- **Structured Message Format**: STOMP manages messages in a structured format consisting of COMMAND, Headers, and Body1. This structure enables clear and consistent communication between clients and servers, making it easier to parse and process messages.
- **Publish-Subscribe Model**: STOMP utilizes a topic-based publish-subscribe model, allowing easy implementation of chat rooms and efficient server-to-server communication2. This model simplifies message routing and distribution.
- **Consistent Protocol Across Layers**: By using STOMP, developers can maintain a consistent protocol from the client-side to the server-side, streamlining development and maintenance processes2.
- **Message Broker Integration**: STOMP can be used in conjunction with Message Brokers, enhancing message routing and delivery efficiency2. This is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time communication.

<Header title="Messaging" subTitle="WebSocket" type="secondary" />
#### 1) User A Logs into DizzyCode:

**WebSocket Connection**

<Box>

[Client]

- Requests a Secondary Token (ST) using JWT.

[Server]

- Validates the JWT and returns an ST with a short validity period (around 30 seconds).

[Client]

- Sends a WebSocket upgrade request with the ST as a query parameter.

[Server]

- Uses HandshakeInterceptor to extract and validate the ST.
- Enhances initial connection security with short-lived ST, then uses JWT for ongoing authentication and authorization in STOMP connections and message transmissions.

</Box>

**Upon successful connection, subscribes to all rooms A belongs to.**

<Box>

- Incoming messages follow the format: `{roomId, categoryId, channelId}`, used for new chat notifications in channels.

</Box>

#### 2) A Enters Channel1 to Chat:

**Subscribes to Channel1**

<Box>

- Messages received on this path are immediately updated on the screen.

</Box>

**Publishes messages to the 'app' topic**

<Box>

```tsx showLineNumbers
if (client && isConnected) {
  const destination = `/app/rooms.${roomId}.categories.${categoryId}.channels.${channelId}`;
  client.publish({
    destination,
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("accessToken")}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
  });
}
```

</Box>

#### 3) Exiting Channel1, Entering Channel2:

- Unsubscribes from Channel1
- Subscribes to Channel2

#### 4) Logout:

- Unsubscribes from all rooms and channels
- Terminates WebSocket connection
