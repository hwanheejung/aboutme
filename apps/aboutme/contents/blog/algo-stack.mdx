<Header title="Infix & Postfix Notations" subTitle="Introduction" />
Infix and postfix notations are two different ways of writing mathmatical
expressions. **Infix notation**, the standard approach in everyday mathematics,
places operators **between** operands (e.g., **2 + 3**). **Postfix notation**,
also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), positions operators **after** their
operands (e.g., **2 3 +**).

While infix notation may seem sufficient for most purposes, postfix notation offers several advantages that make it valuable in certain contexts.

Advantages of postfix notation:

- **Elimination of parentheses** and operator precedence ambiguity
- Easier evaluation using **stack-based algorithms**
- More efficient for computer processing and parsing

Although postfix notation may appear less intuitive for human readers,
it proves highly efficient in computer science applications. It is particularly useful for tasks such as expression parsing and compiler design, and it significantly simplifies the process of expression evaluation.

<Header title="Strategy Setting" subTitle="step-by-step" />

**Step 1: Fully Parenthesize**

- Begin by fully parenthesizing the infix expression to ensure each operation is distinctly marked. For example, the expression `A + B * C` would be fully parenthesized as `(A + (B * C))`. This step guarantees that **there is only one operator within each pair of parentheses**.

**Step 2: Move Operators**

- Move each operator that is directly before a closing parenthesis to just outside that parenthesis. For instance, in the expression `(A + (B * C))`, moving the operators outward results in `(A (B C *) +)`.

**Step 3: Remove Parenthesis**

- Remove all the parentheses. Since the operators have been appropriately placed to maintain the correct order of operations, the parentheses are no longer necessary. After removing parentheses, you get `A B C * +`.

When observing the result, **it preserves the order of operands**. We can set the strategy as:

- **Operands are immediately output**
- **operators are stored until they are ready to be "computed."**

#### Algorithm Breakdown

The key idea is that operands (numbers or variables) are directly output as soon as they are encountered,
while operators are held in a stack until their corresponding operands are ready.
When the operator on the top of the stack has higher or equal precedence than the current operator, it is popped and output.
This guarantees that the correct order of operations is preserved.

```text showLineNumbers
initialize an empty stack s of operands
    for each token x of the expression, from left to right
        if x is an operand then output x
        else
            while top* of stack has higher or equal precedence than x
                pop and output the operator
            push x
    repeat pop and output the operator until s is empty
```

#### Stack Example for `A + B * (C - D)`:

1. Initialize:

   - Output:
   - Stack: `[]`

2. Process `A`:

   - `A` is an operand, so it goes directly to the output.
   - Output: `A`
   - Stack: `[]`

3. Process `+`:

   - `+` is an operator, so push it onto the stack.
   - Output: `A`
   - Stack: [+]

4. Process `B`:

   - B is an operand, so it goes directly to the output.
   - Output: `A B`
   - Stack: `[+]`

5. Process `*`:

   - Since `*` has higher precedence than `+` (currently on top of the stack), we push `*` onto the stack.
   - Output: `A B`
   - Stack: `[+, *]`

6. Process `(`:

   - `(` is an opening parenthesis, so we push it onto the stack to mark the beginning of a sub-expression.
   - Output: `A B`
   - Stack: `[+, *, (]`

7. Process `C`:

   - directly to the output.
   - Output: `A B C`
   - Stack: `[+, *, (]`

8. Process `-`:

   - Since it appears inside the parentheses, we push it onto the stack.
   - Output: `A B C`
   - Stack: `[+, *, (, -]`

9. Process `D`:

   - directly to the output.
   - Output: `A B C D`
   - Stack: `[+, *, (, -]`

10. Process `)`:

    - `)` is a closing parenthesis. Pop operators from the stack to the output until we reach the opening parenthesis `(`.
    - Output: `A B C D -`
    - Stack: `[+, *]`

11. End of Expression:

    - Now that all tokens have been processed, pop all remaining operators from the stack and add them to the output.
    - Pop `*` and `+` from the stack.
    - Output: `A B C D - * +`
    - Stack: []

<Header title="In JavaScript" subTitle="Implementation" />

```javascript showLineNumbers
function infixToPostfix(expression) {
  let output = [];
  let operators = [];
  let precedence = { "+": 1, "-": 1, "*": 2, "/": 2 };

  expression = expression
    .replace(/\s+/g, "")
    .split(/([+\-*\/\(\)])/)
    .filter((c) => c);

  expression.forEach((token) => {
    if (token.match(/[A-Za-z0-9]/)) {
      output.push(token);
    } else if ("+*/-".includes(token)) {
      while (
        operators.length > 0 &&
        precedence[operators[operators.length - 1]] >= precedence[token]
      ) {
        output.push(operators.pop());
      }
      operators.push(token);
    } else if (token === "(") {
      operators.push(token);
    } else if (token === ")") {
      while (operators[operators.length - 1] !== "(") {
        output.push(operators.pop());
      }
      operators.pop(); // remove '('
    }
  });

  while (operators.length > 0) {
    output.push(operators.pop());
  }

  return output.join(" ");
}

// Example
let expr = "A + B * (C - D)";
console.log(infixToPostfix(expr)); // Outputs: A B C D - * +
```
