  Say, we're chatting in a discord channel. The points at which we need to check
  the jwt token are: ①when upgrading to WebSocket protocol, ②when connecting to
  STOMP, ③when sending a message, etc. Steps 2 and 3 are not much of an issue,
  **but a problem occurs at step 1.** Let's find out what the problem is and
  come up with the best solution!
</Section>

<Section>
  <Section.Header title="Problem Definition" />
  <Section.Body>
First, we need to understand the WebSocket upgrading process.

**1. Initial HTTP Request**

The WebSocket connection begins with an **initial HTTP GET request**,
which includes an `Upgrade` header asking to switch the protocol to
WebSocket.

```http
GET /ws HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

**2. Server Response:**

The server approves the WebSocket upgrade with a `101 Switching Protocols` response.

```http
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
```

**3. Protocol Upgrade:**

At this point, the HTTP protocol is upgraded to WebSocket, and further
communication occurs through WebSocket frames rather than HTTP
headers.

This means that, **custom headers are only valid during the initial GET request.** At this stage, it might make sense to try sending tokens via custom
headers. However, once the WebSocket connection is established, all further communication is done via WebSocket frames, and HTTP headers
are no longer used. Additionally, **browsers do not allow certain custom headers to be included in
WebSocket upgrade requests** due to security reasons, such as preventing CSRF attacks.

The above issue is about allowing custom headers during the handshake process, but a Chrome WebSocket contributor argues that **including it in the query string of the URL is also acceptable.**

<Image src={"/blog/dizzycode/1.png"} alt="issue" width={700} />

His reasoning can be summarized as follows:

- The WebSocket URL, unlike an HTTP URL, is not easily exposed, making
  it difficult for unauthorized users to access.
- It is minimally exposed through the JavaScript API, meaning that the
  information included in the query string is unlikely to be leaked
  through other web APIs.
- When using the Authorization header, you'd have to handle a 401
  (Unauthorized) response, but WebSocket APIs do not expose error
  responses to the page for security reasons.

However, while technically viable, **there’s often a lingering concern about
security when sensitive information like a token is included in the
URL, even if the actual risk is low.**

<Section.Header
  title="Sol 2: Sending the Authentication Token with the First WebSocket Message"
  subTitle="Rejected Approaches"
  type="secondary"
/>

  <Section.Body>
In this method, after the WebSocket connection is established, the
client sends the authentication token **as part of the first message.** This means the token is
not included in the headers during the initial connection, but
instead, the client sends a separate authentication message to the
server once the connection is set up.

```ts
client.current = new Client({
  webSocketFactory: () => socket,
  onConnect: () => {
    client.publish({
      destination: "/app/auth",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        token: window.localStorage.getItem("authorization"),
      }),
    });
    subscribe();
  },
  // ...
});
```

    However, this approach has several drawbacks:

    - **Resource inefficiency:** Allowing unauthenticated
      WebSocket connections, even temporarily, can waste server resources
      as the server has to handle these connections before determining
      their validity.
    - **Additional overhead:** This adds a bit of complexity
      to the communication protocol since the server must now wait for a
      separate authentication message after the WebSocket connection is
      established, introducing a small delay.

    title="Sol 3: Sending Token via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol"

  />
  <Section.Body>
  In this solution, the JWT token is included in the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header when establishing the
WebSocket connection. The server then extracts and verifies the JWT
token from this header using a `HandshakeInterceptor`.

```ts title="client (react)"
const socket = new SockJS("http://localhost:8787/ws", null, {
  protocols_whitelist: [
    "v10.stomp",
    "v11.stomp",
    "v12.stomp",
    window.localStorage.getItem("authorization"),
  ],
});
```

```java title="server (spring boot)"
import org.springframework.web.socket.server.HandshakeInterceptor;
import org.springframework.web.socket.WebSocketHandler;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.util.Map;

public class JwtHandshakeInterceptor implements HandshakeInterceptor {
    @Override
    public boolean beforeHandshake(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, WebSocketHandler wsHandler, Map<String, Object> attributes) throws Exception {
        String jwt = request.getHeader("Sec-WebSocket-Protocol");
        if (isValidJwt(jwt)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
            return false;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void afterHandshake(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, WebSocketHandler wsHandler, Exception exception) {
        // Do nothing
    }

    private boolean isValidJwt(String jwt) {
        // JWT validation logic
        return true;
    }
}
```

Umm.. It seems to be very distorted.

    **CONS**

    - **Limited browser support:** Not all browsers fully
      support passing authentication tokens through the
      `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header, which may lead to
      compatibility issues across different platforms.
    - **Misuse of the header:** The `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header is primarily intended for
      protocol negotiation, not for authentication, making this approach
      feel like a **workaround** rather than a proper solution.
    - **Complex token management:** Since this header can
      contain multiple values, managing authentication tokens within it
      may become unnecessarily complicated, especially in cases where
      multiple protocols are negotiated.

  <Section.Body>
  **Including a short-lived authentication token in the query string** may
currently be the most practical and secure approach.

For convenience, I’ll refer to this as ST. This method solves the
security issues I've encountered. Let’s go over the logic step by
step:

> [CLIENT]
>
> - The client requests an ST using the JWT token.
>
> [SERVER]
>
> - The server receives the JWT, verifies it, and issues the ST.
> - The ST has a very short lifespan, typically around 30 seconds.
>
> [CLIENT]
>
> - The client includes the ST in the query parameters when requesting the WebSocket upgrade.
>
> [SERVER]
>
> - The server extracts and verifies the ST using a `HandshakeInterceptor`.

**Once the WebSocket upgrade is complete, the STOMP connection and message transmission use the JWT.**

```ts
async function connectWebSocket() {
  const jwt = window.localStorage.getItem("authorization");
  const secondaryToken = await getSecondaryToken(jwt);
  const socket = new SockJS(`http://localhost:8787/ws?token=${secondaryToken}`);
  // ... STOMP Connection Logic
}
```

    **Advantages of this method**

    - **Short-lived ST:** Since the ST has a very short lifespan, even if exposed, the risk is minimal.
    - **Limited scope:** The ST is used solely for the WebSocket upgrade process, meaning it has more restricted
      permissions compared to a general access token.
    - **Independent management of WebSocket and JWT:** Using an ST allows us to manage the WebSocket connection state
      independently of the JWT’s state. Even if the access token expires,
      we can request a new one before establishing the WebSocket
      connection, keeping the logic cleanly separated.

  <Section.Header title="After WebSocket Connection" />
  <Section.Body title="STOMP Connection">
  After the WebSocket upgrade is complete, we should set up the STOMP connection.
We can use the `connectHeaders` to pass and verify the JWT.

```ts
client.current = new Client({
  webSocketFactory: () => socket,
  connectHeaders: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${window.localStorage.getItem("authorization")}`,
  },
  onConnect: () => {
    console.log("Connected successfully");
    // Subscribe, etc. after connection
    subscribe();
  },
});
```

  </Section.Body>
  <Section.Body title="Message Transmission">
  When sending messages, we can include the JWT in the message headers.

```ts
const sendMessage = () => {
  if (client && connected) {
    client.publish({
      destination: "/app/send",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${window.localStorage.getItem("authorization")}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello, World!" }),
    });
  }
};
```

    In the WebSocket upgrade process, we chose to introduce a secondary token.
    Afterward, the JWT can be used for the STOMP connection and message
    transmission.
