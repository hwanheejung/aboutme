  <Section.Body title="Problem">
    While the `Can I use` website indicates that most modern browsers support WebSocket,
    it's important to note that **it does not support in older versions and specific environments.**
    This limitation can affect the reach and compatibility of applications relying solely on WebSocket.

  <Section.Body title="Solution: Fallback Mechanism">
    Environments that do not support Websocket can use **alternative technologies such as polling, long polling, streaming**, etc.
    This fallback mechanism is used to address browser compatibility issues, and libraries like **SockJS** or **Socket.IO** utilize it.

    Let's slightly dive into how Socket.IO works. According to the [official documentation of Socket.IO](https://socket.io/docs/v4/how-it-works/), it uses long polling as a fallback.
    More specifically, **it initially tries to connect with long polling, and once the WebSocket connection is available, it upgrades.**
    Cuz attempting a WebSocket connection first can lead to delays of up to 10 seconds in non-supporting environments.

    1. Initial GET request: with long polling by default

    2. Client -> Server data send (long-polling)

    3. Data reception (long-polling)

    4. WebSocket upgrade attempt

    5. Upgrade successful. Final request to terminate the existing long polling connection. All subsequent communication takes place via WebSocket.

  <Section.Body title="Problem">
    The WebSocket protocol allows for the transmission of text and binary frames, but **it doesn't provide a predefined format or structure for messages.**
    This lack of structure presents several issues:

    - As projects grow, developers must design and manage complex logic for:
      - Determining message types
      - Handling message transmission between client and server
      - Parsing incoming messages
    - The flexibility in data types and message structures, while offering freedom, also introduces the **burden of definition and management.**
    - Without a standardized approach, maintaining consistency in message handling across different parts of the application can become increasingly difficult.

    These issues highlight **the need for additional protocols atop WebSocket** to provide more **structured communication** in complex applications.

  </Section.Body>

  <Section.Body title="Solution: STOMP Protocol">
    When using STOMP, messages are managed in a more structured format, enabling clear communication
    STOMP stands for Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, a subprotocol that can be used alongside WebSocket.
    STOMP frames consist of COMMAND, Headers, and Body.

    <Box>
      <div>**COMMAND**: The type of message, e.g., CONNECT, SEND, SUBSCRIBE</div>
      <div>**Headers**: Metadata of the message</div>
      <div>**Body**: The actual data</div>
    </Box>

    Let's compare how data is transmitted when sending a simple message like "Hello" using WebSocket alone and when using STOMP alongside it.

    **When using WebSocket alone**, developers themselves must define and manage message structures using JSON, XML, text, etc.

    ```json title="Handmade Structure"
    // client -> server
    {
      "type": "message",
      "content": "Hello"
    }

    // server -> client
    {
      "type": "response",
      "content": "Server received: Hello"
    }
    ```

    **When using STOMP alongside WebSocket**, the message structure follows the format defined by the STOMP protocol.

    ```json title="STOMP Frames"
     // client -> server
     SEND
     destination:/app/hello
     content-type:application/json

     {
       "name": "Hello"
     }
     ^@

     // server -> client
     MESSAGE
     subscription:sub-0
     message-id:007
     destination:/topic/greetings
     content-type:application/json

     {
       "content": "Hello, Hello!"
     }
     ^@
     ```
