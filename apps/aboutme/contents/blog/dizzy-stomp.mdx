# 1. Problems with WebSocket

## 1.1. Limited Browser Support

**Problem**

While the `Can I use` website indicates that most modern browsers support WebSocket,
it's important to note that **it does not support in older versions and specific environments.**
This limitation can affect the reach and compatibility of applications relying solely on WebSocket.

**Solution: Fallback Mechanism**

Environments that do not support Websocket can use **alternative technologies such as polling, long polling, streaming**, etc.
This fallback mechanism is used to address browser compatibility issues, and libraries like **SockJS** or **Socket.IO** utilize it.

Let's slightly dive into how Socket.IO works. According to the [official documentation of Socket.IO](https://socket.io/docs/v4/how-it-works/), it uses long polling as a fallback.
More specifically, **it initially tries to connect with long polling, and once the WebSocket connection is available, it upgrades.**
Cuz attempting a WebSocket connection first can lead to delays of up to 10 seconds in non-supporting environments.

1. Initial GET request: with long polling by default

2. Client -> Server data send (long-polling)

3. Data reception (long-polling)

4. WebSocket upgrade attempt

5. Upgrade successful. Final request to terminate the existing long polling connection. All subsequent communication takes place via WebSocket.

## 1.2. Raw Data Handling

**Problem**

The WebSocket protocol allows for the transmission of text and binary frames, but **it doesn't provide a predefined format or structure for messages.**
This lack of structure presents several issues:

- As projects grow, developers must design and manage complex logic for:
  - Determining message types
  - Handling message transmission between client and server
  - Parsing incoming messages
- The flexibility in data types and message structures, while offering freedom, also introduces the **burden of definition and management.**
- Without a standardized approach, maintaining consistency in message handling across different parts of the application can become increasingly difficult.

These issues highlight **the need for additional protocols atop WebSocket** to provide more **structured communication** in complex applications.

**Solution: STOMP Protocol**
